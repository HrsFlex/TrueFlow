Hey Its HRS's project Named "TrueFlow"

- Empower Your Cycle, Trust Your Flow.

**TrueFlow** is an AI-powered platform designed to help users navigate their menstrual cycle with confidence and ease. It goes beyond just tracking periods—TrueFlow addresses the broader issues of menstrual health, period poverty, and education, offering a comprehensive solution for users.

## 🚀 Features

### Personalized Period Tracker
TrueFlow uses Wolfram Alpha’s instant calculator API to provide users with valuable statistics about their menstrual cycle, such as the number of days until the next period and the current phase of the cycle. This information is presented on a comprehensible dashboard and calendar.

### Menstrual Map
The menstrual map tracks and pins public locations offering free menstrual products for those who can’t afford them. This feature is especially useful for addressing period poverty and ensuring access to essential resources.

### Peppa - The AI Chatbot
Meet Peppa, your AI-powered personal assistant for period management. Hosted using Wolfram’s cloud computing software, Peppa offers reminders, advice, and answers to any questions users may have about their menstrual cycle.

### Product Finder
TrueFlow’s product finder harnesses machine learning to recommend menstrual products tailored to each user’s preferences, lifestyle, and budget. It scans major online retailers like Amazon and Walmart to deliver personalized product recommendations.

### Cyclash - The Educational Parkour Game
Cyclash is an educational parkour game that gamifies learning about the menstrual cycle. Players navigate through challenging terrains while answering questions about menstruation. Incorrect answers result in penalties, such as period cramps that slow down the player's movement.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

### Website
- **Technologies used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API integration**: We leveraged Wolfram Alpha’s API for accurate period tracking and Google Maps for the menstrual map.
- **Design**: Created using Figma for design and Procreate for sprite graphics and logos.

### Game Development

- **Features**: Includes custom sprite animations and AI-generated questions to ensure an engaging and educational experience.

### AI and Chatbot
- **Hosted on**: Wolfram’s Cloud Computing platform
- **Capabilities**: Provides personalized advice, reminders, and answers to menstrual-related questions.

## 💡 Inspiration

TrueFlow was inspired by the lack of comprehensive and accessible menstrual health solutions. We aimed to create a platform that not only provides accurate period tracking but also supports those in need by addressing period poverty. Additionally, TrueFlow includes educational features to help men and women alike better understand the menstrual cycle.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

- **Design to code transition**: Translating Figma designs into HTML while maintaining the aesthetic integrity was challenging.
- **Sprite animations**: Creating complex animations for the game required multiple images and careful coordination.
- **API integration**: Ensuring seamless data flow and real-time updates from multiple APIs was a technical hurdle.
